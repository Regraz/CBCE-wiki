 - Judging (Criteria): 
   - Judges are instructed to be consistent in their judging style across each track when judging.
   - **Expertise (40%)**: Expertise refers to how well the map execute to decetly reflect the elements music. This reflects the technical skill of a mapper. However, in Pending Cup, judging is not modding. Although we promote maps with expertise and professionalism and care about details, Judges are discouraged from being nitpicky on small mistakes or minor unrankables, instead Judges will score in this category considering an overarching picture of the map.
   - **Creativity (40%)**: Creativity refers to how reasonably outstanding the map compared with the current mapping meta. A generic map with the current mapping meta or copy paste the concepts from other "famous" maps is discouraged. Pending Cup promotes creativity so the winners of PDC should guide the mapping meta instead of following it.
   - **Judge's Impression (20%)**: Judges can use this for extra scores or penalties for their specific comments or remarks on something in the entry. The base Judge's Impression score is set to 10, Judges must explicitly mention why they apply addition or subtraction to the score if they wish to change,.+
 - Code of Conduct:
   - Participants are not allowed to make your entry public or share your entry to anyone except PDC hosts before the results announcement of each track.
   - Participants are not allowed to add any information that can help judges reveal your identity.
