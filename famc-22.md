## Motivation and Objectives

Seasonal mapping contests specifically tailored to Featured Artists have achieved tremendous success in osu!taiko and osu!catch with multiple iterations and high participation. This motivates us to host such a venture for osu!'s mapping community. Similarly, the main objective of this contest is to promote new Featured Artist content as well as to provide a platform for mappers across the world to show their mapping skills with less limitations on song selections. Today, we announce the first iteration of FAMC and cordially invite all mappers to participate!

## Contest Highlights

1.	Mappers can freely choose what song they would like to map, as long as the song comes from a recent Featured Artist addition.
    - For the first iteration, we will permit all Featured Artist songs added between `2022-01-01` and `2022-07-27`.
2.	Judges are separated by three categories (Expertise, Creativity and Player Impression), each following specific perspectives and criteria about what they should evaluate.

## Rules and Regulations

### Judging and Scores

1.	There will be 3 categories of judges: Expertise, Creativity and Player Impression, with detailed criteria as follows:
    -	Expertise (40pt): Judges in this category evaluate submissions based on the mapping expertise reflected. Do the elements of the map, including but not limited to rhythms, patterns, hitsounding and flow, clearly represent the music? Are those elements reasonably coherent and consistent across the submission and executed well? Does the map show decent skills and proper knowledge about mapping?
    -	Creativity (40pt): Judges in this category evaluate submissions on their creativity. Does this map look outstanding compared to the majority of maps of osu! beatmaps AND other submissions in this contest? Are the creative elements present rationally and reasonably? Does this map provide new directions and novel concepts for mapping and may potentially shape the future of mapping styles?
    -	Player Impression (20pt): Judges in this category are usually top players of the mode. As this is based on impression, there is no specific criteria. However, judges are required to extensively playtest the submission and provide reasons on the score they assign with this focus.
2.	For Expertise and Creativity categories, there are 3 judges each. For Player Impression, there are 2 judges. 
3.	Judges are required to provide brief but constructive comments as feedbacks to mappers. Code of conduct and general rules of the osu! community is respected during judging.
4.	The total sum of scores from all judges will be the final score of the submission. However, scores from each judge will be standardized if the total number of entries is larger than 8. 
5.	If there is an extremely high number of submissions, a (pre-)screening stage will be added with procedures and details announced.
6.  To promote diversity in judging, the same judge cannot be selected for two consecutive iterations of this contest.

## Ranking and Prizes

1.	Mapper with the highest score of the submissions is the winner of this contest. The entire ranking of all the scores, the judge feedbacks and the submissions will be announced.
